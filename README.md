# Python_PokemonAPI
This Pokémon Database Integration System is a Python project that fetches Pokémon data from the PokéAPI, stores it in an SQLite database, and provides a simple command-line interface to perform CRUD operations. You can view, search, update, and delete Pokémon records, all while interacting with the data seamlessly.
